# Overview

**Protectorate** is a simple PowerShell
script which aims to protect your privacy by reducing tracking, fingerprinting and
disabling unwanted software (Bloatware). With the introduction of Windows 10 (2015),
Microsoft added several changes such as telemetry, unwanted software, always on
services, and online services. There are many tools available to “clean” and
remove unwanted software from your PC, contrary to other options, this script requires
no installation and is fully transparent. In order to be non-disruptive of user
settings, two types of scripts are available:

### Level 1
Only disables telemetry.

### Level 2
Removes unwanted software (OneDrive, Cortana) potentially disrupting
your user experience but furthers strengthens your security. If you don’t need
it, remove it!


**Much more to come!**
